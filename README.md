# Portfolio-Go
I've made a site to show a portfolio about me, what I like, my education, the projects I've done and my contacts. It's mostly a fun projects but I know it serves to show what I know and can do, and it is great.

Most of the project is made with pages using html and css, but using a go back-end to receive the requests.

Then it build the html with templates and repond them properly, using a database (now just a slice inside the code) to search what are the avaliable projects to show and build a card for each of them.

You can access the site with this Portfolio [right here](https://portfolio-uulq.onrender.com/). (It may take around 1 minute to load the free instance on render)
